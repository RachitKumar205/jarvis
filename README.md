# Jarvis

Jarvis is a discord bot built to help manage servers.

## Why?

Because my unbelievably intellectually challenged university does not believe that CS majors literally studying networking as part of their coursework should actually get access to a simple static IP just so they can ssh into the desktop computer sitting in their room.

## How do you use it?

- Set up the env as described in the ```example.env```
- Run ```cargo run```
- To compile a binary, run ```cargo build```
